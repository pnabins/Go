 build a profit calculator,

a command line tool built with Go, of course,

that asks users for revenue, expenses,

and tax rate input,

and that then calculates earnings before tax

and earnings after tax,

as well as the ratio between these two values

and that then outputs these three values.

So that we got such a profit calculator that we can use

to calculate any profit based on these three input values.

Now for that, you can create

a brand new Go project.
